<h2>Project description</h2>  
Where access to restricted content is controlled with an allow list of IP addresses.  
The "allow_list.txt" file identifies these IP addresses.  
A separate remove list identifies IP addresses that should no longer have access to this content.  
I created an algorithm to automate updating the "allow_list.txt" file and remove these IP addresses that should no longer have access.
